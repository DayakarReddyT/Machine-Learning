PM2.5 is considered as the most important air pollution measuring unit. There are few more other factors as well to calculate air pollution.

In this project we are going to predict the air pollution metric PM2.5 using [ "Average_Temp','Max_Temp','Min_Temp','Atm_Pressure',
                                                                 'Average_relative_humidity','Total_rainfall_snowmelt',
                                                                 'Average_visibility','Average_wind_speed','Maximum_sustained_wind_speed' ]

Code is well commented and you can easily understand from scraping the data to deploying the model .
